_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches

This practice files repository has only one branch, `main`, and all the examples are available on that branch. Each movie in the course has a corresponding practice folder named for the chapter and movie number. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Most movies have a beginning and an end state folders. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` folder contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` folder contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.

## Installing

1. Download the practice files to any location on your computer.
2. Open the folder corresponding to the movie you are currently watching.
